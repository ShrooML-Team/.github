# ShrooML-Team

ShrooML-Team is an organization formed by four first-year Master's students in AI / IT at Le Mans University.  
Our goal is to provide AI-powered tools for mushroom recognition, primarily through an Android application, leveraging our previously developed **AutoML Python package**.

## Organization Overview

ShrooML-Team focuses on two main projects:

### 1. ShrooML Android Application

**ShrooML** is an Android application that allows users to:

- Recognize mushroom species from photos using the **AutoML package**  
- Participate in quizzes to compare knowledge on annotated mushroom datasets  
- Submit observations and view confidence scores for identifications  

**Timeline:** February 2026 – April 2026  

**Key repositories:**  
- [ShrooML Android App](https://github.com/ShrooML-Team/ShrooML)  
- [AutoML Python Package](https://github.com/ShrooML-Team/AutoML)

### 2. PoC Mushroom Class Prediction by AutoML

This repository is a **proof of concept** to classify mushrooms as **edible** or **poisonous** using features from the Kaggle mushroom dataset:

- **Dataset:** [Mushroom Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification)  
- **Features:** 22 categorical features describing mushroom morphology  
- **Usage:** GUI tool to predict mushroom edibility based on feature input  

**Repository:** [PoC Mushroom Prediction](https://github.com/ShrooML-Team/PoC_Mushroom_Class_Prediction_by_AutoML)

---

### 3. AutoML Python Package

**AutoML** is a modular Python package for automatic preprocessing, model selection, and training.  

**Features:**

- Automatic task detection (classification/regression)  
- Dataset cleaning, preprocessing, and feature encoding  
- Modular architecture for easy extension  
- Model performance comparison with metrics and plots  
- Minimal configuration required  

**Repository:** [AutoML Python Package](https://github.com/ShrooML-Team/AutoML)

### 3. ShroomLoc

**SchroomLoc** is a python API enabling possible mushrooms species growing near your location.  

**Repository:** [ShroomLoc Python API](https://github.com/ShrooML-Team/ShroomLoc))
